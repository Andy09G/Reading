## iso file

What is an ISO File?
An ISO file, often called an ISO image, is a single file that's a perfect representation of an entire CD, DVD, or BD.

How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?

How do you create an ISO file?
Several programs, many of them free, let you create your own ISO file from a disc or a collection of files you've chosen.

How do you mount an ISO file?
Mounting an ISO file is usually as simple as opening the file with something called a "disc emulator" and then choosing a drive letter that the ISO file should represent.
