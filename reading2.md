Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?


What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?


What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?


Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
